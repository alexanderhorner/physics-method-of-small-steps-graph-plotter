# A Python script plotting traveled distance over time given an acceleration

Using the small-step-method, this script will calculate the distance and velocity for every time step and will plot the distance over time on a graph using [mathplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib). 

The script takes step size (float), acceleration (float), and ammount of steps (integer) as input.
